# hintergrund CMS

Edit static content with hintergrundCMS.
Give editors granular access to their website's static content by using GitHub as your database and access it with your self-hosted, serverless instance of hintergrund CMS.

### Why git?

Version History, branches

### Why serverless?

Only use computing resources when you need them. No need to pay for a server that is running 24/7 when you only need it a few times a day/week/month.

**Our philosophy:** Only pay for what you use, only use what you need.

_Most cloud providers offer a generous free tier for serverless functions._

### Advantages

No database, no server, no vendor lock-in

### When to use hintergrund CMS

hintergrund is best suited for simple websites that are authored by a few and consumed by many.

hintergrund manages static resources like images, text, and structured data in JSON or Markdown files.
It is not suited for dynamic content like user-generated content, comments, or other data that changes frequently.

## Development

Stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with auth and managing infrastructure. Connect APIs with code when you need it and no code when you don't.

Start with only the things you need and add things once you need them, not before.
