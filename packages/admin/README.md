# hintergrund CMS

Edit static content with hintergrundCMS.
Give editors granular access to their website's static content by using github as your database and access it with your self-hosted, serverless instance of hintergrund CMS.

## Why git?

Version History, branches, editor workflow (possibly), no vendor lock-in, no database, no server, no maintenance, no costs.

## Why serverless?

No server setup and maintenance, little costs.

## Why not headless?

Site owners want to edit their content in context instead of having to switch between a CMS and the website. This is especially true for static websites.
